###Some Scenarios to Demonstrate Functionality for Grading
NOTES: 
- These scenarios will all be very simple, since they are meant to demonstrate particular
functionalities of SimCity - one at a time. It'd be quite difficult to see through the print
statements what was going on if many scenarios were running at once, so these grading aids
make it easier by doing one scenario at a time. To see lots of things happening at once (at 
the cost of clarity) call the last scenario (# PUT THE NUMBER IN).
- Most scenarios will end in the person sleeping.
#### 1. Buses
Start SimCity, and create a new person. Enter the name as "Bus Ride". This will add the
bus system to the city, and will create a single person name "Rider". Rider will choose to
Rider will choose to go to the bus stop, ride the bus, and go home. In this particular case,
riding the bus is out of the way for Rider, but this is just because we are simply trying to
demonstrate the bus system's functionality.
#### 2. Bank Customers
Start SimCity and open the Person Creation panel. Enter the name as Bank. This will create 3
people and will make give them all the job of Bank Teller, but with different shifts. It will
add a bank to the city. When everything is created, all three new people will go to the bank,
one to start his shift, and the other two to do business. To see inside the bank, click on the
bank in the main city view. As you'll see, soon after the scenario starts, the first teller
will get off work and help the others with their remaining business, and the same will happen
for the last teller as well. The banking can be seen in the animation or more specifically in
the print statements. Afterwards, they all go home to sleep.
#### 3. Nothing
